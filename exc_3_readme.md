Instructions
I was reading this article by Tim Urban - Your Life in Weeks and realised just how little time we actually have.

https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html

Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.

It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:

You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.

Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.

Warning your output should match the Example Output format exactly, even the positions of the commas and full stops.

Example Input
56
Example Output
You have 12410 days, 1768 weeks, and 408 months left.
e.g. When you hit run, this is what should happen:



Hint
There are 365 days in a year, 52 weeks in a year and 12 months in a year.
Try copying the example output into your code and replacing the relevant parts so that the sentence is formated the same way.
Test Your Code
Check your code is doing what it is supposed to. When you're happy with your code, click submit to check your solution.
